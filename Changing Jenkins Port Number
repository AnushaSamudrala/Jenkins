Suppose if wanted to launch two applications on two servers simultaneously then the port numbers of two servers must be different.
As it is known that the port numbers of Tomcat and Jenkins servers are same (i.e., 8080).
In this kind of situations, the port number of either of the servers must be changed.
So, here we can change the jenkins port no. :

Open the C folder of your local system --> program file 86--> Jenkins--> Jenkins (XML file) right clcik and edit with notepad++ -->
press ctrl+F on that xml file and search by typing 8080(shows the port no)-->edit to 8085(changes the port no of jenkins).

Now restart the jenkins server:
In your local system--> search services--> Jenkins --> Restart
Now in browser type localhost:8085--> open the jenkins server.
