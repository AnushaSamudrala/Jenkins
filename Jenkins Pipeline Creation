Adding more jobs to pipeline:

To the above build pipeline, you can add other jobs just by clicking the another job which you want to run next and in that job go to 
configure option.
In build triggers tab, select the option of build after other projects are build.
Then give the name of the project which you want to run before this project and select any option of  trigger only after the build 
succeded or failed or even unstable.
So, the builds will run as per the series of jobs added to pipeline that is created.
